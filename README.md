Web scrapping and analysis of peace bridge wait times

PHP script executes on a server of mine (boatdance.com) every five minutes and appends peace bridge wait time data to a csv file on the same server

Stata .do file takes the raw csv files and massages it for data analysis, converting string to numeric, etc. 

For the data itself, as it's a live feed, the most recent update may be found at:
